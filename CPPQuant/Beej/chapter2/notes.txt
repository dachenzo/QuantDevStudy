SOCK_STREAM - uses TCP and SOCK_DGRAM - uses UDP

A layered model more consistent with Unix might be:
• Application Layer (telnet, ftp, etc.)
• Host-to-Host Transport Layer (TCP, UDP)
• Internet Layer (IP and routing)
• Network Access Layer (Ethernet, wi-fi, or whatever)


IPs are divided into the network section and host section
to get the host section u can use a bit mask

typicallIP: 192.0.2.12/30. The /30 tells u how many network bits present

TCP and UDP use port numbers for their addressing

Network Byte Order =  Big - Edian


| Function  | Description           |
| --------- | --------------------- |
|  htons()  | Host to Network Short |
|  htonl()  | Host to Network Long  |
|  ntohs()  | Network to Host Short |
|  ntohl()  | Network to Host Long  |



NAT - Network Address Translation - Usually done by the firewall and is used to switch from public IPs to Private IPs
