An lvalue is anything that has a name while an rvalue is anthing that isnt an lvalue

rvalue parameters are specified with &&
lvalue parameters are specified with &

std::move casts an lvalue to an rvalue.its should be thought of as std::rvalue

whne an object is a moved state (i.e its an rvalue). I can either be destroyed or reassigned
