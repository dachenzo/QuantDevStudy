In summary, each object passes through the following stages:
1. The object’s storage duration begins, and storage is allocated.
2. The object’s constructor is called.
3. The object’s lifetime begins.
4. You can use the object in your program.
5. The object’s lifetime ends.
6. The object’s destructor is called.
7. The object’s storage duration ends, and storage is deallocated

An automatic object(one that has automatic storage duration) is allocated at the begining of a code block and deallocated athe the end.
in a function body the parameters have automatic duration

u can give a variable thread storage duration. by specifying it as thread local
 static thread_local int power = 200;

In cpp an object is a region of storage that has a name and a type.
