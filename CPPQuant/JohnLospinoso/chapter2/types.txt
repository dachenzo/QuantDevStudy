User definde types are broadly:
Enumerations
Classes
Unions


Enums are either scoped or unscoped.


UNSCOPED::
enum Color { Red, Green, Blue };
enum Traffic { Red, Yellow, Green };

Color c = Red;         // OK
Traffic t = Red;       // OK
int x = Green;         // OK (implicit conversion!)


SCOPED::
enum class Color { Red, Green, Blue };
enum class Traffic { Red, Yellow, Green };

Color c = Color::Red;       // OK
Traffic t = Traffic::Red;   // OK
// Color c2 = Red;          // Error: ‘Red’ not in this scope
// int x = Color::Green;    // Error: no implicit conversion



Structs are classes and they are the most basic.
Generally structs are linear in memory so u should always irder them from biggest to smallest.


In a struct members are public by default
