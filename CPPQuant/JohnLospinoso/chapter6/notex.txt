const_cast only works on reference types and pointers - its used to remove const from existing const pointers and references, technically, it returns a new non const type, so the original is still const.


static_cast basically formalises casts that were implicitly allowed before

U can replace argument types with concepts

Variadic templates allow u to define a list of params (zero or more)
syntax: template<typename T, typename... Arguments>
        T& func(Arguments... args) {
            return new T{args}
        }
