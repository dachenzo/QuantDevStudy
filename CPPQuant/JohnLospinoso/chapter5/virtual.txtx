A method declared as virtual can be overrided in a child class and these gives rise o run time polymorphism due to the vtable and vpointer. 

a class with a virtual method with "= 0" cannot be initialised and these methods are called pure virtual methods and must be overrided in child classes


Include virtual destructors in destructors, cpp tries to call the method of the pointer type so to make it look at the vtable fro the object u need to mark the base class destructor as virtual.
